# Dungeon-Explorer
I decided to combine everything I had learned while teaching myself java into one game. This is a game where you play as a guy exploring a dungeon while defeating monsters. I made this during my first semester of junior year in highschool.

WHAT I LEARNED:
- shadows
- images (manipulation, drawing, and importing)
- OOP
- Game loops
- Dungeon random Generation
- Enums
- Gui
- Drawing
